Jenny tells us about her experience:

Change is a good thing!

## What can disrupt a team?

- People leave and join teams

- Emotions are critical! (Larah Hogan desk move blog post)

## What can you do?

- Work on yourself first
  - We can prepare for change
  - Don't do it all yourself
  - Give people your trust
  - Build your support network
  - Set yourself up to lead sustainably
- Make the teams work ownable
  - Define a single, clear goal, because focus is invaluable
  - Communicate it over and over again
  - Give your team the background they need for each piece of work (User Story Context, Story Kickoffs, Workshops)
- Empower the team to own it  
  - Embrace opportunities for positive change
  - Become great at integrating new people into the team (constantly improve onboarding)
