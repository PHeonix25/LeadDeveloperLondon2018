There is a lot of value in systems that scale your effort. \
I can't get it all done - everyone is short on time.

Learning how to scale yourself is not a one-time task, it is continual. \
If you're in a fast moving company, this will need to happen at least every 6-9 months

## Communication

- Manager Readme - check out Oren Ellgnbogen
- Personal Branding and Self Promotion is essential
- You need to have confidence - imitate a gorilla :)
- Don't let your weaknesses blind you - you need to give, solicit and receive feedback:
  - ASK VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
  - Google Manager Feedback Survey

> The single most important communication skill you have to learn is to say NO.

## Prioritisation

- Everyone gets the same amount of time in a week
  - Make lists!
  - Complete a time-audit one week and then prioritise it
  - Eisenhower Matrix
- **Multitasking is a scaling antipattern**
  - Calendar Blocking + TIme boxing to get into the flow
  - Delete as many recurring meetings as possible
  - Email and Slack hit the neurocortex to make you happy. Close them and timebox responses.

> Obsess on the things that matter!

## Delegation

- LET IT GO
- Delegate **DECISIONS** (not just actions) to avoid being a bottleneck!

## Personal Development

- Take care of yourself first - it's lonely so find a peer/support group
- Menatal Fatigue, burnout and illness is severly underrated.

> Make yourself a priority once in a while. It's not selfish, it's necessary.

- Professional sports have managers and coaches, so find one!
- Mindfullness and meditation can significantly improve your life: _2-5min a day = Headspace app?_
- Read every day! _It creates empathy and reduces cognitive decline. If Obama can do it, why can't I?_

> If you take care of yourself, your teams will take their cues from you and do the same!
