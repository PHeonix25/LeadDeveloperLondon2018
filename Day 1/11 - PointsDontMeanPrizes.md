## Introduction

Story time, talking about the North Star

## Customers don't care about stories, or points

They just want the value that the story will give them!

### NOTE

_There was a good story about Customer Journeys; watch the video._

## Three questions that can help

1. Can we take a story and bin it (or delay it)?
2. Can we take a story and thin it?
3. Can we take a story and split it? (into smaller stories that definitely provide value?)

Feel free to rinse and repeat this process into infinity!
