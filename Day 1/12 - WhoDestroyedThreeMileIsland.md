# 'Who Destroyed Three Mile Island' by Nickolas Means (VP Eng @ Muve Health) @nmeans

**Great** story about how a Nuclear Reactor works and how this one melted down.

Work from the Participants Reality. \  
Assume positive intent.

## Two common types of bias

1. Hindsight Bias
1. Outcome Bias

## Key takeaways

- Human Error is never the cause: ask WHAT is responsible for an accident, not WHOSE fault it is.
- Understand WHY it made sense.
- Seek FORWARD accountability, not BACKWARD.
- Always look for the second story.

## Read

- 'How things work', the 4-book series.
- 'The Field Guide to Understanding "Human Error"' by Sidney Dekker

## Notes

Give this talk to the NOC, Matt & Willem ASAP.
