Solid intro!

Google Maps as the example, one-of-the-first, if not the first SPA done well!

## How?

- Application-like experience
- Dynamic in-page updates
- API-driven data
- Client-side routing and history

- Hard to make them GOOD
- EXTREMELY hard to make good, simple, fast and maintainable ones!
