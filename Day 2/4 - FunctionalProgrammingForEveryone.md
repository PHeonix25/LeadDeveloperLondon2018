# Functional Programming for Everyone by Marek Rogala (CTO @ Appsilon) @marekrog

Journey analogy with three stops

## First Stop: Immutability Island

- Immutable is much better:
  - no side effects,
  - no hidden inputs,
  - no surprises.

Code is easier to reason about, test and parallelise.

_Key Takeaway_: Immutability & no side-effects

## Second Stop: Declarative Desert

Define the WHAT, not the HOW.

Code is easier to understand, optimise and reuse.

_Key Takeaway_: Design around the WHAT.

## Third Stop: Perspective Peak

> Functions are first-class citizens

No loops, different mechanisms for developing & designing systems. \
Frameworks come and go, but learning a new way of thinking will never get outdated.

_Key Takeaway_: new perspective on programming

## Call to Action

- Give developers ideas and space to learn & play
- Talk about relevant gains
- Set expectations
- Share resources

## Notes

- Interesting introduction, very broad, but seems quite awkward
- Wow, journey analogy popped out of nowhere.
