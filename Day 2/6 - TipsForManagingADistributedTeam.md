# Tips for Managing a Widely Distributed Team by Dirkjan Bussink (Principal Engineer @ GitHub) @dbussink

Managing - what is managing \
Widely - what about when they are across the globe \
Team - A group of people!

## Why do you want a distributed team?

- Good people are scattered around the world, why don't you want access to them.
- Not everyone wants to move.
- Some people just don't like the idea of working in an office

## My Team at GitHub

- Based in Amsterdam
- Distributed across the globe - 11 countries, many locations.

## Main premise

Most teams start in an office, and add a few remote people. This doesn't work well.
You should start a team if you want to be remote, as a "talking head".
Using the example of the Slack outage yesterday, most people in offices are already working "remotely" via Slack messages.
Using an example of two people on a desk talking in chat, moved the conversation into a public channel and someone elsewhere in the world was able to contribute.

## Psychological Safety

- Why? Google Study, successful teams are psychologically safe
- First steps, travel to the same place and get together
  - Do this regularly!
  - Use this time well
  - Discuss Long term strategy
  - Team structure discussions
  - Iterate on collaboration processes
  - Don't just do day-to-day work!
  - Do non-work activities
    - Grab dinner together
    - Build social capital
    - Lightning talk sessions
- Keep talking
- Build trust in 1:1's
- Non-work video chats (personal calls? Virtual water-cooler?)
- Be timezone aware (don't just do it in the same timezone)
- Asynchronous communication!!!
- Public communication, you don't jump in sound-proof booths for other communications, so don't use private channels
- Status updates can be completely offline/async!
- No instant gratification
- Unblock others & don't block yourself
- Over-communicate!! (DRY is not a bad thing in management) but as a manager, use restraint!
- Stop working outside of hours
- Literally, hardly anything is urgent
- Use "timezome spread" to your advantage

## Recap

- Everyone is distributed
- Work hard on building team bonds
- Enable async workflows
- Use the power of distributed teams

## Notes

- Generally seemed like a bunch of thoughts and "good ideals" for remote teams.
- Not really a solid, consistent story.
