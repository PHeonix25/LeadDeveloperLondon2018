# 'How to Run Awesome Tech Internships' by Beverley Newing (FE Dev @ Oxford Computer Consultants) @webdevbev

Bev has had 3 internships, CodeFirst:Girls, Zooniverse, OCC, and now a solid contract.

## Why?

Diversity status currently sucks: 15% of grads were female. \
We can create internships to increase diversity.

## What?

- Within a team, working alongside the team
- Should be 6 months, 3 months too short, 12 months too long.
- Salary should be a living wage (not national minimum wage, a realistic living wage)
- There should be a project that they own, something they can be proud of.
- Support is required: a close mentor and proper team integration

## How?

- Be nice in interviews!
- Enable planned learning
- Regular check-ins
- Include them in team meetings

## Notes

- Very airy-fairy
