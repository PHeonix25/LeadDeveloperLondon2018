# 'Goal-Setting Workshops for Managers' by Melinda Seckington (Technical Manager @ FutureLearn) @mseckington

> _Where do you see yourself in 5 years time?_

Techniques like SMART, GROW, etc. are about helping people reach their goals... not about discovering the goals! \
This is where Goal-Setting Workshops come in! \
You get to generate as many ideas as possible about the future...

> _Try and go Wide, rather than Deep._

The format of the workshop can vary greatly:

- One catchup, or several?
- Some questions beforehand (seeding) or impromptu?
- Provide enough time and space for the candidate.

Four main sections:

- Values
- Future
- Current Role, and
- Current Skills
  
> _NOTE: INSERT SLIDE WITH LAYOUT_

## Values

> What are your values?

Lots of reflection & introspection. \
_Personality tests and quizzes might help for this stage?_

## Future

> What do you want in your future?

Lots of prospection & toekomstmusiek. \
_Maybe you can phrase this as avoiding anti-goals?_

## Current Role

> How is your current role? Likes/Dislikes?

Lots of reflection (within the current scope). \
_You can use a job description or a career-development framework for this discussion._

## Current Skills

> What are your current strength and weaknesses?

What do they do well? What needs to be improved?
_Look at skill matricies, or performance analysis tooling?_

## Now What? What's next for you?

From here, once this is documented well, this should help you identify key areas for goals (if not the goals themselves)

Doing these exercises will help you avoid Technical Debt in Human-form :)
